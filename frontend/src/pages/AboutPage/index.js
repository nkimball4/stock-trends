        chatter is a platform that sifts through Twitter chatter about companies and applies AI-based sentiment analysis to gauge whether the overall sentiment is positive or negative. We're driven by the belief that understanding public sentiment is crucial for predicting stock price movements. By analyzing the collective sentiment of recent tweets, we aim to provide a clearer picture of the rumors and discussions that can influence stock prices. Our goal is simple: to decode the chatter and provide traders with valuable insights to inform their decision-making process.
